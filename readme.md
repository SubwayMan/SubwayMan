### Hi! congratulations on stumbling upon my profile.

----------
I'm Tyler, a software developer from Vancouver, Canada. I'm currently studying software engineering at the University of Waterloo. Here's a quick glimpse of what I do:
- I program games and game engines. Here's my favourite game that I've made so far: [link](https://pixelpad.io/app/lfgzohcupbm/).
- I'm fairly decent at competitive programming. Currently rated [Expert](https://codeforces.com/profile/wolfram_) on codeforces (86th percentile).
- I've got almost *too* many side projects, nearly all of which are in this github. Here are some highlights:

### Python
Python has been my most comfortable language to code in since around 2019. Here's some highlights:
- [FLTK Platformer](https://github.com/SubwayMan/FLTK-Platformer) - A platformer built on top of a hacky custom game engine.
- [Hamber place](https://github.com/SubwayMan/hamber-place) - A replica of reddit's r/place created as an activity for Eric Hamber's programming club, built on top of Django.
- [Discord escape room](https://github.com/SubwayMan/discord-escape-room) - A discord bot that uses discord channels and permissions as well as interactive features to simulate an online escape room.
  
### Arduino projects
I started learning the arduino in early 2023. Since then, I've made a couple cool projects:
- [The Tilting Game](https://github.com/SubwayMan/The-Tilting-Game) - a simple game that uses a gyroscope and an LED matrix.
- [Cansat](https://github.com/nuggetbucket54/CanSat) - a miniature satellite designed to record seismic data and transmit via LoRa radio.
- [Tamaduino (WIP)](https://github.com/SubwayMan/tamaduino) - a nostalgic callback to the old handheld toys, with my own flair added.
