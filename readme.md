### Hi! congratulations on stumbling upon my profile.

----------
I'm Tyler, a 18 year old developer from Vancouver, Canada. I'm currently studying software engineering at the University of Waterloo. Here's a quick glimpse of what I do:
- I program games for a website named [pixelpad.io](pixelpad.io). To see them all, check out my [profile](https://pixelpad.io/apps/?u=19216) on pixelpad.
- I'm fairly decent at competitive programming. Currently rated [Expert](https://codeforces.com/profile/wolfram_) on codeforces (86th percentile).
- I've got almost *too* many side projects, nearly all of which are in this github. Here are some highlights:

### Python
Python has been my most comfortable language to code in since around 2019. Here's some highlights:
- [FLTK Platformer](https://github.com/SubwayMan/FLTK-Platformer) - A platformer built on top of a hacky custom game engine.
- [Hamber place](https://github.com/SubwayMan/hamber-place) - A replica of reddit's r/place created as an activity for Eric Hamber's programming club, built on top of Django.
- [Discord escape room](https://github.com/SubwayMan/discord-escape-room) - A discord bot that uses discord channels and permissions as well as interactive features to simulate an online escape room.
- 
### Arduino projects
I started learning the arduino in early 2023. Since then, I've made a couple cool projects:
- [The Tilting Game](https://github.com/SubwayMan/The-Tilting-Game) - a simple game that uses a gyroscope and an LED matrix.
- [Cansat](https://github.com/nuggetbucket54/CanSat) - a miniature satellite designed to record seismic data and transmit via LoRa radio.
- [Tamaduino (WIP)](https://github.com/SubwayMan/tamaduino) - a nostalgic callback to the old handheld toys, with my own flair added.

I'm still learning, so I'm looking forward to making many more cool projects. Hopefully they don't involve web dev too much.
