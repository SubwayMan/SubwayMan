### Hi! congratulations on stumbling upon my profile.

----------
I'm Tyler, a 17 year old developer based out of Vancouver, Canada. Here's a quick glimpse of what I do:
- I've got almost *too* many side projects, nearly all of which are in this github. 
- I program games for a website named [pixelpad.io](pixelpad.io). To see them all, check out my [profile](https://pixelpad.io/apps/?u=19216) on pixelpad.
- I'm fairly decent at competitive programming. Currently rated [Expert](https://codeforces.com/profile/wolfram_) on codeforces (86th percentile).
